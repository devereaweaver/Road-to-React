# Road-to-React

In 2023, I wrote an inventory management system for use by coffee roasters ☕️ with some buddies...we didn't really know what we were doing at the time. 
(See? https://github.com/devereaweaver/F1-App)

We even create two separate Github repos and somehow just had to copy and paste things back together, what a mess.

It worked 🤷🏾‍♂️ BUT in retrospect, we could have improved the developer experience by taking advantage of some good JS frameworks and/or libraries. 

I want to try rewrite that thing using React and TypeScript this time!...

Problem...I don't really know react that well.

Solution..."The Road to React".

Plan: Learn enough React to implement the necessary rewrite and hope that application comes out better!
